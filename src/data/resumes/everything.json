    "summary": "High-agency Data Professional with a unique background blending rigorous social science research with production-grade engineering. My experiences, including graduating top of my class at Cal after navigating homelessness, gave me a unique perspective and a drive to build useful, ethical tools. I specialize in bridging the gap between 'notebook data science' and scalable infrastructure. My core expertise lies in architecting end-to-end data systems—from raw ingestion (Dagster/dbt) and warehousing (BigQuery/Athena) to deploying predictive models (Propensity Scoring, NLP, Churn) that drive revenue. I bring a software engineering mindset to data teams, championing CI/CD, unit testing, and modular design. Whether acting as a solo data lead or a core contributor in high-growth startups, I focus on untangling complexity to build tools that are explainable, maintainable, and directly impactful.",

As soon as they joined, they immediately took initiative on a complex survey design and analysis project that was critical to our success, bringing both expertise and ownership from day one.\n\nJack’s approach is highly collaborative and mission-driven. They actively engage with departments across the organization, listen closely to their needs, and build thoughtful, scalable solutions—including dashboards, data quality reports, and automated systems that allow staff to focus on their core work with students. Jack is systems-oriented and consistently plans for long-term, sustainable outcomes.\n\nOne standout example: Jack streamlined a survey and analysis process that previously took our team a month, developing a replicable system that now delivers actionable insights in just a few days. This perfectly captures their ability to problem-solve proactively and significantly boost our efficiency and decision-making.\n\nBeyond their technical and strategic skills, Jack is reliable, resourceful, and generous with their knowledge.

      "reference": "I had the pleasure of interviewing Jack before they joined the SetSail team-- I gave them a 4 out of 4. It's important to note that on our hiring scale, a 4 meant \"I will flip the table if you don't hire this person.\" One thing that stuck with me after the interview, and which was reaffirmed while we worked together at SetSail, is Jack's enthusiasm for data science and their love of learning (and sharing what is learned).\n\nNot only is Jack an extremely capable engineer and data scientist, they are also a collaborative team player who elevates everyone around them. Their contributions at SetSail were always valuable to the company-- whether it was their huge role in our data pipeline migration, or countless bug fixes and feature implementations that directly improved our user experience, you could always count on Jack to get the job done on time, with clean code, and great documentation. I wholeheartedly recommend Jack for any data science position—they would be an invaluable addition to any team."
